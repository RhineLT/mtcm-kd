# Multi-Teacher Cross-Modal Distillation with Cooperative Deep Supervision Learning for Unimodal Segmentation
This is a noval approach for unimodal segmentation of brain tumor while taking leverages from all the modalities during training using multi-teacher cross-modal knowledge distillation along with cooperative deep supervision learning (CDSL). The unimodal approach in our technique mainly target the `T1ce` modality for the inference because of its availibility and the amount of information it carries to solve the problem of automation of brain tumor segmentation. Moreover, our final model; specialized trained for `T1ce` modality, also produce better results for the `T1` modality without any extra-fine tunning or training.
