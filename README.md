# Multi-Teacher Cross-Modal Distillation with Cooperative Deep Supervision Fusion Learning for Unimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation
This is a noval approach for unimodal segmentation of brain tumor while taking leverages from all the modalities during training using multi-teacher cross-modal knowledge distillation along with cooperative deep supervision fusion learning (CDSFL). The unimodal approach in our technique mainly target the `T1ce` modality for inference because of its availability and the amount of information it carries to solve the problem of automation of brain tumor segmentation. Moreover, our final model; specialized trained for `T1ce` modality, also produce better results for the `T1` modality without any extra-fine tunning or training.
